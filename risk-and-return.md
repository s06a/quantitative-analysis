# Risk and Return

average return is misleading, having the same average return doesn't mean that you're gonna end up with the same amount of money

## return of an asset

Simple return
```math
R_{t, t+1} = \frac{P_{t+1} + D_{t,t+1}}{P_{t} - 1}
```

multi period return
```math
R_{t,t+2} = (1 + R_{t,t+1})(1 + R_{t+1, t+2}) - 1
```

annual return based on monthly return
```math
R_{a} = ((1 + R_{m})^12 - 1)
```
